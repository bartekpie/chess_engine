Chess enigne basis project

You can take this project and use structures and functions to generate possibleMoves efficiently - that is a key of chess engine. 

I used bitboard as Unsigned Long Long U64 to represent binary ChessState. Using bit operations and arrays that are calculated at the begging you can generate possible move for given 
ChessState really efficiently 

Main function has just basic chess game loop so you can use just as as simple chess game but it was not motivation for this project 

Main purpose was to provide structures and methods for efficient chess engine.
